Description Brief – Manuel Alejandro Acosta 

Web Portfolio 

 

My experience with Responsive Web Design just starts in this semester, for me was very challenging to understand and develop this kind of projects. When I start to create my mock-up, I try to do it simple for users in order to have a clear navigation and engaged with the content.  

For improve more my skills, I follow the material in GitHub section of the course, also W3schools was a good guide and some YouTube tutorials in order to see more examples. Again, for me this is very complex, but I try to understand it and keep practicing. Finally, when we start the Bootstrap week it was a salvation for me.  

I used Bootstrap for creating my web portfolio because that show me a very clearer knowledge and understanding of the html structure. I'm a visual person and I try to see the templates or final designs comparing with the html structures and that provides me more security and confidence with the development. For that reason, I use the examples available in Bootstrap page, one called “carousel”, “album” and the “checkout” which gives me a guideline for my website.  

I share with you the list of frameworks, libraries, plugins and fonts that I used for my Web Portfolio in order to give credit and recognition for the authors. This also is well commented in the html and style sheet files.

To sum up, I really learn and challenge myself in order to be able to create a website from coding or using any frameworks. Abhy thanks for all the support and attention that you give us during all this course. I really enjoy it, sorry for not having use more things in my assignment but I must be honest and I'm trying to keep understanding and learning from this. However, it has been a great experience for me and for sure I will improve and work during my break in my portfolio website.
